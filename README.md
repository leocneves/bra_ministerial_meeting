## Brazilian's Ministerial Meeting

***

The focus of this work is to explore the **transcribed audio** from the recently announced video about one of **brazilian's Ministerial Meeting** that came to public within judicial order.

The CNN Brasil published the [news](https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/politica/2020/05/22/assista-ao-video-da-reuniao-ministerial-com-bolsonaro) and the video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjndWfgiRQQ). To transcribe the audio I use YouTube button that automatically generate the text about the video and I readed and treat this text with pandas. The text can be found [here](https://github.com/leocneves/bra_ministerial_meeting/dataset/reuniao_ministerial.csv).
